tensorflow/tensorflow,https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/9376#issuecomment-325026287,file_name,"I think the CMake problems stem from some confusion about the idiomiatic way to include custom op libraries in tf.contrib. (This doesn't appear to be well documented, so it's not your fault!)
To outline the steps:
1. Since b2ac11c, we've been statically generating the Python wrappers for all contrib op kernels (on all platforms and build systems). Have a look at that commit to see how to do that; it's quite possible that you're already generating them with the existing Bazel rules. The important thing to note is that the imported symbol(s) for the new ops should come from the gen_*_ops module rather than the result of load_op_library().
2. To make the build easier on Windows, delete the AddUserOps from tf_python.cmake. Including the source files in the list of tf_contrib_kernels_srcs in tf_core_kernels.cmake should be enough to get the code statically linked into the Python extension (which is a somewhat easier route to take on Windows).",tf_python.cmake,
tensorflow/tensorflow,https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/9376#issuecomment-325026287,file_name,"I think the CMake problems stem from some confusion about the idiomiatic way to include custom op libraries in tf.contrib. (This doesn't appear to be well documented, so it's not your fault!)
To outline the steps:
1. Since b2ac11c, we've been statically generating the Python wrappers for all contrib op kernels (on all platforms and build systems). Have a look at that commit to see how to do that; it's quite possible that you're already generating them with the existing Bazel rules. The important thing to note is that the imported symbol(s) for the new ops should come from the gen_*_ops module rather than the result of load_op_library().

The TL;DR was we considered NGINX, routing inside the app and a separate redirection 'layer' (i.e. serve). The conclusion was that the order of preference was app routing > serve > NGINX, but we tried to get Gatsby to handle the redirects and failed.
Unless you've changed your mind about this, I'm fine with continuing to use serve until either Gatsby changes or we migrate to something else that allows us to handle the redirection in the app. What do you reckon?",#42596,

flutter/flutter,https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/11609#issuecomment-388484681,issue_number,"@eseidelGoogle,
How would Intellij and/or VS Code (with Dart-Code) be able to set breakpoints and step through code from a .dsx file ? (I mean this is not a .dart file). How about auto-complete functionality from the .dsx file (as with a .dart file) ?
You have invested a lot on the tooling but the tooling does not support pre-processing (with source maps) of a new language (like DSX) that transpiles into Dart/Flutter seamlessly.
A transpiler is available but there is no easy way to fully integrate it:

Using features in Electron (or even having to introduce a native module for that purpose) comes at the risk of being exposed to exotic bugs because not a lot of other Electron applications are using these features and Electron is constantly moving forward with latest Chrome updates.
To give concrete examples: VSCode is supporting macOS sierra native tabs as well as simple fullscreen support and only these 2 were a constant source of issues and frustration when they were not working anymore (see #35361, #75054).
Even though Electron exposes an API to set windows as transparent, there is no guarantee that this feature will remain supported in future updates.

microsoft/vscode,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/106448#issuecomment-742371268,issue_number,"Here is the result of the UX meeting with some additional requirements before we can merge this:
the editor actions on the top right should move to bottom right in the last row and should not consume the entire vertical space so that the rows above can fill the entire width
when workbench.editor.tabSizing: shrink is configured, tabs should not fill the last row and all tabs should have an even size across all rows
we should have a limit as to how many rows we support (e.g. 3 or 4) and not just rely on the minimal editor height
